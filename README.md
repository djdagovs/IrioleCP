# IrioleCP
A CentOS based web server control panel - currently in early, *early* alpha development stages.

Use at your own will - however I cannot guarantee it will run very smoothly, or run well at all. This is a project at the very beginning of it's time.
It's a rewrite of it's older brother which was written in CodeIgniter - however this will be written in a semi-MVC environment.

Not really sure what the requirements or dependencies are just yet - this is the first commit after all...
The first few commits will be the server side setup, and will probably just download any PHP files using WGET. We'll see.
